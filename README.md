Our project is a web app where users can log in to a discussion forum, similar to Quora or reddit, uses will be able to create and delete answers, create and delete topics or simply just scroll through forums. If users are not logged in they will not be able to create or delete anything and they will only have the permission to scroll through forums. We've also implemented session management into our project.
