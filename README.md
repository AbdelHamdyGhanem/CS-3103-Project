This is a discussion forum web application similar to Quora or Reddit. Hosted on UNB servers, users can log in to create forums, join existing ones, and participate by posting answers.
Users must be logged in to write comments or create forums. They have the ability to delete only their own forums and responses.
Additionally, users can search for topics, forums, and responses using keywords or by their ID to find relevant discussions.

The platform uses RESTful APIs to handle several tasks:

	•	User Authentication API: Manages user login and registration processes, ensuring secure access.
	•	Forum Management API: Enables the creation, deletion, and retrieval of forums and comments.

These APIs ensure smooth and secure interactions within the forum.
